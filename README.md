# Parliament Voting Records Database
This application allows an admin to upload XML files of voting results from the Parliament voting system. For laws that are passed, the admin can then connect all 3 sessions of the law's votes together and publish the law to the votes.parliament.ge website. The public can then view the voting records for passed laws by law or by parliament member.

# XML File From Parliament Voting System
The XML file is a list of all items on the agenda for one day. The following data can be found in the file:
* Date of the session (conference tag)
* List of parliament members (delegate tags)
* List of parties that members belong to (group tags)
* List of items that were on agenda (agenda tags)
* List of voting sessions for agendas that had votes (voting session tags)
* List of voting results for a voting session (voting result tags)
